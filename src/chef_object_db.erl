%% @doc Deletes an object from the database and queues a delete of the object's data in the
%% search index (Solr). Throws an error if the database delete operation fails. Crashing on
%% db error and not performing the solr deletes is the right thing because: if the data is
%% still in the db, then the entire operation can be retried. The object will still be
%% searchable and accessible; if the data was actually deleted despite the error return,
%% then the orphaned solr data are of little consequence, data returned from searches is
%% pulled out of the db so it will be as if the data was correctly deleted. If we deleted
%% the solr data when a db error was encountered, we could have data in the db that could
%% not be findable via search.
